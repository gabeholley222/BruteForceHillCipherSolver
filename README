# BruteForceHillCipherSolver
These are programs to brute force attack 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 matrices with suspected cribs.
Note that 2x2 may take a few moments to give results, while 3x3 and 4x4 will take months of continuous run-time to get results.

Update: 3x3 would take approximately 135 days to run through every iteration.

Will update with 4x4 potential run-time.
